# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is Chris's Prework Study Guide Webpage. In the following:

- I am learning new skills that can lead to a new career path.
- I built this project because learning by doing in much easier than learning by reading for me. Once I am able to repeat tasks over and over again, I pick up on things easily and can solve some problems without having to go back.
- This problem solved some time in advance in learning some basic features of what we will be learning in the future course to come.
- I learned some basic features of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub, Git, and basic ReadME files.
